# üîç GitHub Repository Troubleshooting

## ‚ùå Issue: Repository Not Found
The push failed because GitHub can't find the repository.

## üßê Possible Causes:

### 1. **Repository Not Created Yet**
- Did you complete all steps at https://github.com/new?
- Did you click "Create repository" at the end?

### 2. **Wrong Repository Name**
- Make sure the repository is named exactly: `EnMapper` (with capital E and M)
- Check at: https://github.com/kshitijpatilhere/

### 3. **Different Username**
- Make sure you're logged into GitHub as: `kshitijpatilhere`
- If your actual GitHub username is different, we need to update the remote URL

## üîß Quick Fixes:

### Option A: Verify Repository Exists
1. Go to: https://github.com/kshitijpatilhere/EnMapper
2. If it shows "404 Not Found", the repo doesn't exist yet
3. Create it at: https://github.com/new

### Option B: Check Your Actual GitHub Username
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/profile
2. Look at your username
3. If it's different from `kshitijpatilhere`, tell me what it is

### Option C: Create with Different Name
If `EnMapper` is taken, try:
- `enmapper-ai`
- `enmapper-platform`
- `data-mapper-ai`

## ‚ö° Once Repository Exists:
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

## üÜò Need Help?
Tell me:
1. Did you successfully create the repository?
2. What's your actual GitHub username?
3. What name did you use for the repository?
